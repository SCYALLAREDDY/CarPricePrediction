# CarPricePrediction
This project builds a car price prediction model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in R, based on features like make, fuel type, body style, and engine specifications. The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictions and analyze pricing trends.
